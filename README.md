# iiitb_r2_4bit_bm -> Radix-2 4-Bit Booth's Multiplier

## Description

This project simulates the Radix-2 4-Bit Booth's Multiplier using Verilog HDL. It can be used to multiply two 4-bit binary signed number in a efficient manner with less number of addition operation. 

## Introduction

Booth's Multiplier is based on Booth's Multiplication Algorithm. It proposes an efficient way for multiplying two signed intergers in there 2's complement form such that the number of partial products is reduced which ultimately lead to the reduction of number of addition operation required for generating the final result.

## Application

Booth's Multiplier can be found to have wide application in field of Digital Signal Processing such as

* They can be used as a fundamental unit for MAC block.
* They can be used in filters like FIR and IIR.
* They can be used in Processing Element of Systolic Array. 

 They can basically be used in any application requiring high speed multiplcaition.
