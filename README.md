# iiitb_r2_4bit_bm -> Radix-2 4-Bit Booth's Multiplier

## Description

This project simulates the Radix-2 4-Bit Booth's Multiplier using Verilog HDL. It can be used to multiply two 4-bit binary signed number in a efficient manner with less number of addition operation. 

## Introduction

Booth's Multiplier is based on Booth's Multiplication Algorithm. It proposes an efficient way for multiplying two signed intergers in there 2's complement form such that the number of partial products is reduced which ultimately lead to the reduction of number of addition operation required for generating the final result.

## Application

Booth's Multiplier can be found to have wide application in field of Digital Signal Processing such as

* They can be used as a fundamental unit for MAC block.
* They can be used in filters like FIR and IIR.
* They can be used in Processing Element of Systolic Array. 

 They can basically be used in any application requiring high speed multiplcaition. 
 
 ## Block Diagram 
 
The Booth's Multiplier perform iterations of shift, addition and subtraction operation in order to produce the result.

As shown in the Block Diagram, Q and M are 4-bit registers that stores the multiplier and multipliicand respectively. It also consist of a 4-bit arthematic unit capable of performing both addition and subtractions. A MOD-4 counter is also present in order to keep track of shifting operation. A and Q are 4-bit shift register. The product is produced in 8_bit register P.  

## Working 

The  multiplication operation through Booth’s algorithm is efficient compared to traditional shift and multiplication process because it produces the result with lesser addition operation. 

![](images/Flowchart_crop.jpg)

The above figure shows the flowchart of Booth’s Algorithm. At every clock cycle the two bits (Q<sub>0</sub> , Q<sub>-1</sub>)  are inspected for determination of operation .The Q<sub>0</sub>  refers to Q[0]. If the (Q<sub>0</sub> , Q<sub>-1</sub>) are same (1,1) 0r (0,0) then only right shift operation is performed. If the (Q<sub>0</sub> , Q<sub>-1</sub>) are same (1,0) then subtraction (A-M) followed by right shift is performed. If the (Q<sub>0</sub> , Q<sub>-1</sub>) are same (0,1) then addition (A+M) followed by right shift operation is performed. This cycle is repeated as many times as the specified bits of Booth’s Multiplier is given. This selectivity in performing addition /subtraction operation enables it to produce result efficiently.

## Physical Design

### Preperation

The Physical Design is performed using the OpenLane flow. In order to accomplish it certian preparation has to be done . Copy the `config.json` to the `Openlane/designs/iiitb_r2_4bit_bm` directory. Also copy the `iiitb_r2_4bit_bm.v` , `sky130_vsdinv.lef` , `sky130_fd_sc_hd_fast.lib` , `sky130_fd_sc_hd_slow.lib` and `sky130_fd_sc_hd_typical.lib`  in `Openlane/designs/iiitb_r2_4bit_bm/src`. The contents of the `config.json` file are  

```
{
    "DESIGN_NAME": "iiitb_r2_4bit_bm",
    "VERILOG_FILES": "dir::src/iiitb_r2_4bit_bm.v",
    "CLOCK_PORT": "clk",
    "CLOCK_NET": "clk",
    "GLB_RESIZER_TIMING_OPTIMIZATIONS": true,
    "CLOCK_PERIOD": 10,
    "PL_TARGET_DENSITY": 0.7,
    "FP_SIZING" : "relative",
    "pdk::sky130*": {
        "FP_CORE_UTIL": 40,
        "scl::sky130_fd_sc_hd": {
            "FP_CORE_UTIL": 30
        }
    },
    
    "LIB_SYNTH": "dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib",
    "LIB_FASTEST": "dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__fast.lib",
    "LIB_SLOWEST": "dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__slow.lib",
    "LIB_TYPICAL": "dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib",  
    "TEST_EXTERNAL_GLOB": "dir::../iiitb_r2_4bit_bm/src/*"

}
```

Now, open the terminal in the OpenLane directory, and type the following commands to invoke it

```
make mount
```
Now to run the OpenLane flow in the interactive mode enter the command

```
./flow.tcl -interactive
```
Now to proceed to import the design for the physical design under the desired tag

```
prep -design iiitb_r2_4bit_bm -tag ASIC
```

Now to merge the sky130_vsdinv lef file to the merged.nom.lef enter the following commands one after the other 

```
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs
```
!

### Synthesis 

The synthesis in the OpenLane flow is carried out by `yosys` . After that the technology mapping is carried out by the `abc`. After that an static timing analysis (STA) is carried out by the `OpenSTA`.

To run synthesis enter the command 

```
run_synthesis
```
!

#### The Synthesis report 

The statistic regarding the skywater130 cells which are mapped on to the design.
!
```
Flop Ratio = Ratio of total number of flip flops / Total number of cells present in the design = 24/112 = 0.2143
```
STA report 
!

IF the macro sky130_vsdinv is synthesised on the design then the sky130_vsdinv will be reflected on the sythesised netlist.
!

### Floorplan 

`init_fp`  - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
`ioplacer` - Places the macro input and output ports
`pdn`      - Generates the power distribution network
`tapcell`  - Inserts welltap and decap cells in the floorplan

To proceed with floorplan enter the command 

```
run_floorplan 
```
!

Core Area
!
Die Area

#### Floorplan View

To view the floorplan in `magic` navigate to the directory `OpenLane/designs/iiitb_r2_4bit_bm/run/ASIC/result/floorplan` and then enter the commands

```
magic -T /home/yashm98/openlane_dir/OpenLane/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech ../../tmp/merged.nom.lef def read iiitb_r2_4bit_bm.def &
